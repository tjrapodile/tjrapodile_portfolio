This repository contains my latest portfolio website, built using modern web development tools and libraries.
The site showcases my work, skills, and experience, with a focus on delivering a visually engaging and interactive user experience.

Features:
3D Elements- The site incorporates 3D graphics and animations using Three.js, adding a dynamic and interactive layer to the design.
Responsive Design- Tailwind CSS is used to create a fully responsive design, ensuring the website looks great on all devices.
Project Showcase- Detailed sections for showcasing my projects, with interactive elements and smooth transitions.
Fast Development Workflow- Vite is used for rapid development and optimized build processes.

Tech Stack:
React + Vite- React.js for building the user interface, with Vite providing a fast and efficient development environment.
Three.js- A powerful library for creating 3D graphics directly in the browser. Used for adding interactive 3D elements to the site.
Tailwind CSS- A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies styling and ensures responsive design.
